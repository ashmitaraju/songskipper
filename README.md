# Song Skipper 

Song Skipper is a system which detects songs in Indian movies and provides an option to skip the song. 

We analyze the video clip using audio processing algorithms to identify a song. A skip song button is shown everytime a song is detected in the movie and the user can click on it to skip the video.
